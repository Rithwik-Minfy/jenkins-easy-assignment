4. Brief summary

In this assignment, I learned how to navigate the key components of Jenkins, including the main dashboard, job configuration, and build history. 

I created a simple pipeline job named 'HelloJenkins' and configured it with stages for building, testing, and deploying an application.

After running the pipeline, I monitored its execution through the Console Output and Stage View to track each stageâ€™s progress and success.

I also modified the pipeline by adding a new 'Cleanup' stage, which allowed me to observe how changes in the job configuration affect subsequent builds.

This exercise gave me hands-on experience with Jenkins' job creation, pipeline setup, and build monitoring features, enhancing my understanding of continuous integration and deployment processes.
